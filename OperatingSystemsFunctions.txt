You can use the Windows button (Start menu) in the lower left hand corner, to find different applications. Ypu can even use it to find different files on the computer. Or even go to files, settings, ore even power down the computer
In Windows 10 you can use the tiles, to have different games or other apps quickly accesible. you can pin fequently used apps onto it. Like if you use microsoft office all the time, you can use that on there if you want to. Usually when you first download Windows 10 it comes preloaded with garbage. 
Another function is, Administration mode. You can have a set "Administrator" account. and you can restrict other users from downloading other stuff onto the computer without Admin approval. So if you hasve a kid that likes to download random crap on your computer that may or may not have viruses, and restrict it so that you can not have to worry about getting those viruses.
